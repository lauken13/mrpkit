This vignette presents the typical workflow of MRP-Kit, an R package for implementing a "grammar" for multilevel regression with post-stratification.


# Introduction

The aim of MRP-Kit is to use a grammar to perform Multilevel Regression with Poststratification (MRP). By using this package, you follow a specific workflow of MRP from creating the metadata of the survey and post-stratification objects, mapping these objects to each other, fitting the model, getting predictions, aggregating values, and visualizing the results. Hence, it creates a more reproducible and accountable environment for conducting MRP.

Unlike many R packages, MRP-Kit uses [Object Oriented Programming (R6 objects)](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/r6.html) (Chang, 2019). Thus, instead of calling a function to perform a task, we call a method that is embedded to an object using `object$method`. Typical usage of this package will create four objects: `SurveyData`, `SurveyQuestion`, `SurveyMap`, and `SurveyFit`. There are several methods in each of these objects that will be explained later in this vignette.   


# Prerequisites

Some of the methods in MRP-Kit use external packages i.e. `forcats` (Wickham, 2020) in `SurveyMapping$mapping`, `dplyr` (Wickham, François, Henry & Müller, 2020) in  `SurveyMapping$tabulate`, and `ggplot2` (Wickham, 2016) in `SurveyFit$visify`. To fit the MRP model, you might also need these packages:

- rstanarm (Goodrich, Gabry, Ali, & Brilleman, 2020), at least 2.21.0 version
- brms (Bürkner, 2017)
- lme4 (Bates, Maechler, Bolker, Walker, 2015) and merTools (Knowles & Frederick, 2020)


# Workflow

The workflow to use MRP-Kit to implement MRP is:

1. Prepare the data.
2. Create the `SurveyData` objects.
3. Match the values between the survey and post-stratification datasets for each question.
4. Map the questions between the survey and post-stratification datasets.
5. Fit the model.
6. Get the estimated value based on the post-stratification dataset.
7. Aggregate the prediction value to some level of instance, for example for state/province basis. 
8. Visualize the estimated data. 

A more detailed example of this workflow follows.

## Prepare the data  - Add education in the data and state (5-10 states) in the data

In this vignette we simulate survey and post-stratification datasets. These datasets display the preference of voters to the Neverland Labor Party (NLP), a political party in a fake country, Neverland, along with demographic variables, age and gender. The population is designed using `declare_population` from `DeclareDesign` (Blair, Cooper, Coppock & Humphreys, 2019) to set the features in the population.

We can see every variable in the survey data as follows:

```{r nlp-survey}
head(nlp_survey)
```

Additionally, the approximate population can be seen as follows:

```{r nlp-popn}
head(approx_voters_popn)
```
 

## Create the SurveyData objects 

`SurveyData` objects are used to represent both the survey and the post-stratification datasets, along with their metadata. The survey metadata consists of the survey's variables, the questions that were asked, levels of the responses, survey weights, and the survey design formula (random sample, one stage cluster sample, and stratified sample).

This object has three methods: `SurveyData$new`, `SurveyData$print`, and `SurveyData$clone`. The `SurveyData$new` method is used to transform a regular dataframe to a `SurveyData` object, whereas `SurveyData$print` and `SurveyData$clone` are used to print and clone the created `SurveyData` object. 

In this example, we will show the steps to create the `SurveyData` object using `SurveyData$new` method. This method takes five arguments, which are the metadata of the survey and post-stratification data, listed as follows: 

1. `data` : Dataframe i.e. survey or post-stratifcation data that would be transformed to a `SurveyData` object.
2. `questions`: The question asked in the questionnaire for each of those columns.
3. `responses`: Allowed response for each question.
4. `weights`: The survey weights.
5. `design`: The design formula of the survey, including:
   - `~.` for a random sample
   - `~ (1|cluster)` for one stage cluster sample
   - `~ stratum:` for a stratified sample

After `SurveyData` is initialized, we can print it using the `print` method as shown below.

**Create the `SurveyData` object for the survey data set**
   
```{r survey-object}
# create the SurveyData object for survey data
nlp_pref <- SurveyData$new(
  data = nlp_survey,
  questions = list(age = "Please identify your age group",
                gender = "Please select your gender",
                vote_for = "Which party did you vote for in the 2018 election?",
                highest_educ = "Please identify your completed highest education",
                state = "Which State do you live in?",
                y = "If today is election day, will you vote for the NLP?"),
  responses = list(age = levels(nlp_survey$age),
                   gender = levels(nlp_survey$gender),
                   vote_for = levels(nlp_survey$vote_for),
                   highest_educ = levels(nlp_survey$highest_educ),
                   state = levels(nlp_survey$state),
                   y = c("no","yes")),
  weights = nlp_survey$wt,
  design = formula("~."))

# print it
nlp_pref$print()
```

**Create the `SurveyData` object for the post-stratification dataset**


```{r poststrat-object}

# create SurveyData object for post-stratification data
popn_obj <- SurveyData$new(
  data = approx_voters_popn,
  questions = c(age_group = "Which age group are you?",
                gender = "Which gender are you identified?",
                vote_pref = "Which party do you prefer to vote?",
                education = "What is the highest grade or level of school you have completed",
                state = "Please identify the state where you live in"),
  responses = list(age_group = levels(approx_voters_popn$age_group),
                   gender = levels(approx_voters_popn$gender),
                   vote_pref = levels(approx_voters_popn$vote_pref),
                   education = levels(approx_voters_popn$education),
                   state = levels(approx_voters_popn$state)),
  weights = approx_voters_popn$wt,
  design = formula("~."))

# print it
popn_obj$print() 
```


## Match the value between survey and post-stratification object using `SurveyQuestion$new`

From the metadata above, we can see that the survey and post-stratification data have different column labels, so to do the level/categorization of age, gender, party preference, highest level of education, and state. For example in `nlp_pref`, the column label for age is `age`, whereas in `popn_obj`, the column label for this variable is `age_group`. This variable also has different levels, `nlp_pref` has seven levels of age, whereas `popn_obj` has only four levels of age. 

These column labels and levels should be aligned to be able to perform MRP. With the `SurveyQuestion$new` method, we are able to align the names of the columns and mapping their values. Further, if there is a meaningful ordering over the values, they should be sorted over that order, either descending or ascending. 

This method takes three arguments:

1. `name` : the name for the variable, which is used in the modeling stage.
2. `col_names`: the column labels in the survey and post-stratification object that the variable refers to.
3. `values_map`: mapping the values between the survey and post-stratification object.

Here is the example of how this method works:

```{r questions}
# create SurveyQuestion$object for the question related to age
q1 <- SurveyQuestion$new(
  name = "age",
  col_names = c("age","age_group"),
  values_map = list(
    "18-25" = "18-35", "26-35" = "18-35", "36-45" = "36-55",
    "46-55" = "36-55", "56-65" = "56-65", "66-75" = "66+", "76-90" = "66+"))

# create SurveyQuestion$object for the question related to party preference
q2 <- SurveyQuestion$new(
 name = "party_pref",
 col_names = c("vote_for","vote_pref"),
 values_map = list("Neverland Labor Party" = "NLP", "NLP" = "NLP", "Neverland Democrats" = "The Democrats", "The Democrats" = "The Democrats"))

# create SurveyQuestion$object for the question related to gender
q3 <- SurveyQuestion$new(
  name = "gender",
  col_names = c("gender", "gender"),
  values_map = data.frame("male" = "m", "female" = "f", "nonbinary" = "nb"))

# create SurveyQuestion$object for the question related to education
q4 <- SurveyQuestion$new(
  name = "highest_education",
  col_names = c("highest_educ", "education"),
  values_map = list("no high school" = "no high school",
                    "high school" = "high school",
                    "some college" = "some college",
                    "associates" = "some college",
                    "4-year college" = "4-years college",
                    "post-graduate" = "post-grad"))

# create SurveyQuestion$object for the question related to state
q5 <- SurveyQuestion$new(
  name = "state",
  col_names = c("state", "state"),
  values_map = list("State A" = "A",
                    "State B" = "B",
                    "State C" = "C",
                    "State D" = "D",
                    "State E" = "E"))

```


## Using the SurveyMap object

The `SurveyMap` object holds the mapping between a set of items in the survey and post-stratification datasets. It takes the `SurveyData` objects, which in this case are `nlp_pref` and `popn_obj`, together with labels and values that have been matched and provided in the `SurveyQuestion` object. The mapped object would specify the correspondences in the variables that will be used when fitting the model. 

The `SurveyMap` object has eight methods:

1. `new`
   
    This method is used to initialize a new `SurveyMap` object. This takes `SurveyData` and `SurveyQuestion` objects as its arguments. It should be noted that we should include all of the `SurveyQuestion` objects that correspondence to variables that will be used in the MRP model.
   
2. `validate`

    This method is used for `SurveyMap` object validation. It will throw an error if there is a level mismatch in the map. Additionally, it will give a warning when one or more variables are available in the post-stratification dataset but they are not mapped (thus would not be used in the model). 
    
    Below is the example of `new` and `validate` methods usage:

```{r map-object}

# create a new SurveyMap object
ex_map <- SurveyMap$new(samp_obj = nlp_pref, popn_obj = popn_obj, q1)

# validate the map
ex_map$validate()

```

3. `add`

    To get rid of the warning above, we could use this method to add other `SurveyQuestion` objects to the map. Here is the example of the code:
    
```{r add}
# add party_pref and gender to the map
ex_map$add(q2, q3, q4, q5)
print(ex_map)
```

4. `delete`

    Now we already have all of the variables in the post-stratification dataset mapped. Sometimes, you do not want to include all of the variables in the post-stratification matrix, for example, in this case, we want to exclude `party_pref` from the matrix using the `delete` method.

```{r delete}
# we can also use the label instead of the object name
ex_map$delete("party_pref")
print(ex_map)
```

5. `replace`

    Replace is used to replace the matching level in one question, not between different question.
    
    Suppose that you changed your mind and want to use another level of matching for a certain question. For example, in question regarding education, q4, you want to change the "associates" level to be equal to "4-years college". To do this, you can firstly create a new `SurveyQuestion` object corresponding to that new level mapping. Secondly, you can use the `replace` method to change the question object. This method takes two arguments, namely `old question` as the first argument and the `new question` as the second argument. The example of these steps could be seen as follows:
    
```{r replace}
# create a new SurveyQuestion corresponding to the new level matching
q4_new <- SurveyQuestion$new(
  name = "highest_education",
  col_names = c("highest_educ", "education"),
  values_map = list("no high school" = "no high school",
                    "high school" = "high school",
                    "some college" = "some college",
                    "associates" = "4-years college",
                    "4-year college" = "4-years college",
                    "post-graduate" = "post-grad"))

# replace the old question with new question
ex_map$replace(q4, q4_new)
print(ex_map)
```
    
6. `mapping`

    Once you are happy with your map object, you can prepare the mapped data for model fitting with the `mapping` method. 

```{r mapping}
ex_map$mapping()
```


7. `tabulate`

    The next step is to prepare the post-stratification table using the `tabulate` method. If you want to only use a certain variable in the post-stratification matrix, then you should put that variable as the argument. For instance, here, we only use `age` in the post-stratification matrix.

```{r tab-1}
ex_map$tabulate("age")
```

If you want to include all of the variables in the post-stratification matrix, then the method should not take any arguments.
    
    
```{r tab-2}
ex_map$tabulate()
```


8. `fit`

    Finally, we are able to fit the model using `fit` method. Currently this package supports `rstanarm::stan_glmer`, `lme4::glmer`, `brms::brm` as the built-in functions. However, you could also specify your own function. In this case, you should give a `data` argument that accepts a dataframe. In this example, we fit two models using `fun=rstanarm::stan_glmer` and `fun=lme4::glmer` with `age` and `gender` as the predictors. 

```{r  fitting}
# the example of using stan_glmer
fit1 <- ex_map$fit(
  fun = rstanarm::stan_glmer,
  formula = y ~ (1|age) + (1|gender),
  family = "binomial",
  refresh = 100,
  cores = 2)

# the example of using glmer
fit2 <- ex_map$fit(
  fun = lme4::glmer,
  formula = y ~ (1|age) + (1|gender),
  family = "binomial")

```


## Playing with the fitted model with `SurveyFit`

In this stage, we already have the fitted model object i.e. `fit1` and `fit2`. These objects have been automatically stored as `SurveyFit` objects. Further, using this object, we can generate the predicted probabilities for all post-stratification cell, aggregate the estimate to a higher level, for example to provide state or province estimates, and visualize the aggregated estimates. 


### Get the prediction value of each post-stratification cell

After creating the `SurveyFit` object, we are able to generate the predicted probability of each post-stratification cell using the `predictify` method. It returns a matrix with rows that correspond to the columns of post-stratification data and columns that correspond to the posterior samples. 

Furthermore, if the model fitting is done with one of the built-in function (`rstanarm::stan_glmer`, `lme4::glmer`, `brms::brm`), then this method does not take any arguments. However, if you used a customized function in the model fitting, then this method takes two argument. The first is the fitted model object, and the second is the post-stratification dataframe. In this example, we will show how to use this method for the `mod_fit_1` object. 

```{r predict}
# predict the probability of voting for the NLP using the fit1 model
poststrat_fit1 <- fit1$predictify()
```


### Aggregate the prediction to a higher level of estimate

The next step is to generate the population estimate or group estimate using the `aggregate` method. This method takes two arguments, namely the post-stratification estimate data and the variable that is aggregated. In this example we want to aggregate `age` and `state` variable. If the variable is not specified, then this method would generate a population estimate. 

```{r aggregate}

# aggregate the predicted value by age
age_preds <- fit1$aggregate(poststrat_fit1, by = "age")

# aggregate the predicted value by state
state_preds <- fit1$aggregate(poststrat_fit1, by = "state")

# generate the population estimate
popn_preds <- fit1$aggregate(poststrat_fit1)

```

This method then will return a dataframe with variable levels, the draw/iteration, and the probability of the `y`. In this example, `age_preds` represents the age-group, the draw, and the probability of voting for the NLP party for each age-group and each draw. 

```{r show-aggr}
head(age_preds)
```

### Visualize it

Once we have the aggregated value of the estimates, we are able to visualize it using the `visify` method. This method takes the aggregated data frame as the argument. It generates a violin plot of the estimated aggregated variable or the population prediction. In the example below, we show the example of the estimate of `age` and `state` variables. 

```{r age-vis}
plot_age <- fit1$visify(age_preds) 
plot_age
```

The plot above shows the distribution of NLP support for each age-group. We can see that the probability is normally distributed in each age-group. The plot also implies that people who are aged 56-65 are most likely to vote for the NLP.

The next plot displays the probability of voting for the NLP by state. We learn that the probability of the NLP winning the election is high since the majority of people (around 75%) in all of the states in Neverland vote for that party. 


```{r state-vis}

plot_state <- fit1$visify(state_preds)
plot_state

```
