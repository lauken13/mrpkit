# mrpkit

This packaged is designed to created a structured workflow for using Multilevel Regression and Poststratification, and associated methods. The package assists you in setting up the survey data and relationships between different variables in the sample and the population. From there, a substantial amount of data cleaning is automatically completed, saving time and reducing risk of coding errors. The package has native support multilevel binomial and bernoulli models fit with lme4 (considerably faster), brms and rstanarm. In addition, addtional modelling techniques are easily added due to the use of object orientated design. Simple visualizations are provided, complete with weighted comparisons (if provided).
