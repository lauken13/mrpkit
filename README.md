**NOTE: This package is still a work in progress and is yet not released
or officially supported**

For students and researchers who are comfortable with at least `glm()`
and want to conduct multilevel regression with post-stratification
(MRP), `mrpkit` provides a reproducible, opinionated, and highly
structured workflow. Unlike writing all the code yourself, using
`mrpkit` proactively addresses many common issues, and makes it possible
for folks who are new to MRP to quickly conduct their first analysis.

The package assists in setting up the survey data and relationships
between different variables in the sample and the population. From
there, a substantial amount of data cleaning is automated, saving time
and reducing the risk of coding errors. The package has native support
for multilevel binomial and Bernoulli models fit with lme4 and Stan (via
brms and rstanarm) and also allows for the use of custom modeling
functions. Summaries and simple visualizations of the resulting
post-stratified estimates are provided.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `mrpkit` from GitHub:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("lauken13/mrpkit")
```

### License

`mrpkit` is licensed under an MIT license. See the `LICENSE.md` file.
